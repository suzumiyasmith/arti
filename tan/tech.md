# Preliminaries & Tech explanation

## Concept
Sharding: Zilliqa, Rchain, Eth, Region, Difinity, TON
Sharding Strategy: Hard, Soft, Status
Hetero Network: Plasma, Liquid, RSK, Cardano, AELF, Elastos, LSK, ARDR, MOAC
(SideChain, subchain, cross-chain)
Circle: Cosmos, Polkadot
Off-chain: TA, AE, Lightning Network, Raiden, Liquidity Network, Trinity, Waves, TrueBit
DAG: TPS solving

Cryptocurrency Governance (DAO)
ref: Egalitarian Society or Benevolent Dictatorship: The State of Cryptocurrency Governance

## Distributed System
CAP CAC
ACID BASE


## Consensus Algorithms
PoS
Casper
CRDT COPS

# BASIC Logic
1. philosophy
2. implementation
  1. TA Consensus: WPoS, VRF, PoX, subchain, folk theory(game theory), Consensus decoupling
     - paticipation: Miner, space owner(root chain), witness, honor(game theory)
     - pro: governance, customisable protocol consensus, sharding, patrition, CE(strong consist), TSE(ms delay), multilayer consensus, neutron???, WHC(resouce, extension), ability to build distributed subsystem


sapce owner in WDC: BST, TMT, MTP

FGTM: honor, 海盗博弈, 

DPOS, PBFT: divergence on blockchain incresement

WHC: Walk Alone Chain, Neural Network Chain
CE: Consistency Engine
MHN: Mobius Hypercube Network (Hypercube)
神经映射?? Bloom Filter

TSE: (HIC: Hybrid logical clock = vector clock + ?global clock)
Lamport vector clock
globle clock consensus(kick via tit for tat)
refered by WHC

CE: cockroachDB, hbase
N-tree(similar to MHN, improved DHT)

Anna: distributed strorage POC, Actor mode
